# Setting up the Raspberry Pi

A nice and somewhat "cool" way of working with the robots involves connecting them with a Raspberry Pi.
You can even power the Raspberry Pi from the iRobot Create viathe GPIO pins on the Pi, which is pretty snazzy.

See the [lab-raspi repository](https://github.com/rldotai/lab-raspi) for details on setting up the Raspberry Pi's OS, software, and components .
